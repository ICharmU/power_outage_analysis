# Major US Power Outages (2000-2016)
Supplementary project for DSC 80.

## Introduction
Over time, power outages have had an increasing impact with the increased use of digital technologies. Preventing these outages can be useful for keeping the US productive. When researching electrical grids working with [this](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages) power outage dataset, I focused on the economic and climate factors related to power outages.  

This outages dataset contains information from January 2000 to June 2016 for power outages occurring in US states (including non-continental states). The uncleaned dataset contains 1534 observations and 55 features. The most interesting columns were anomaly level and NERC region. Based on an oceanic temperature index, variations in ocean temperature at the time of the outage were reported. These temperatures were cyclical with an increasing amplitude toward 2016. This feature was useful when considering what the climate was like at the time of the outage (e.g. cold, hot) The NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation) regions differentiated the primary electrical power supplier for each state. During the mid 2000's there was a NERC merger that needed to be accounted.
